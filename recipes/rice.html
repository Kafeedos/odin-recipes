    <h1>Jollof Rice</h1>
    <img src="../images/rice.jpg" alt="rice image">

    <p>So I decided to record an Oven Baked Jollof rice recipe. Y’all know I’m the queen of Jollof right? LOL… Seriously though, I’ve got several Jollof no-fail Jollof recipes on the blog already. If you ever try any of my Jollof recipes and it doesn’t work for you, promise to refund you the amount you spent on the ingredients </p>

    <p>For this recipe, bear in mind, I used Basmati rice. Other rice type cooking time will vary. Also, if you’re using long grain rice, you’ll need to parboil your rice first to speed up the cooking time. Also, do not skimp on White Pepper and Ginger, they really are important ingredients to help increase the flavor of Jollof rice. Butter is also important as it helps replenish the lost moisture and lushness during the high heat cooking process, especially if you’re working with Basmati rice.
